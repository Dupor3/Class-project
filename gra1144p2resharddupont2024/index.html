			<h3>Flaky Beef-Stuffed Pinwheels</h3>
			<p>Wow your friends with this delicious beef appetizer. Fully-cooked beef Pot Roast from your grocery store is mixed with cheese and wrapped in puff pastry. Even though you take a short cut, you can take all the credit.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>1 package (16 to 24 ounces) fully-cooked boneless beef pot roast with gravy</li>
			<li>&frac12; cup shredded asiago cheese</li>
			<li>1 package (17.3 ounces) frozen puff pastry (2 sheets), thawed</li>
			<li>4 green onions, cut in half lengthwise, then cut into thin long strips</li>
			</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h4>Cooking</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Heat beef Pot Roast with Gravy in microwave according to package directions. Remove pot roast from container; discard gravy. Shred pot roast in large bowl with 2 forks; stir in cheese. Set aside.</li>
				
				<li>Heat oven to 400&deg;F. Coat 2 metal baking sheets with cooking spray. Unfold each puff pastry sheet onto lightly floured surface.</li>
				
				<li>Cut each sheet in hallf with sharp knife or pizza cutter to make four 10 &times; 4&frac34; inch rectangles.</li>
				
				<li>Working with 1 rectangle at time, place a long side in front of you. Place &frac14; of the beef mixture onto pastry, leaving a &frac12;-inch border on the long side closest to you. Lay &frac14; of the green onion strips lengthwise over beef mixture. Roll up pastry jelly-roll fashion starting with long side opposite you. Brush water along border and seal pastry. Repeat with remaining pastry, beef mixture and green onions.</li>
				
				<li>Cut pastry rolls crosswise into &frac12;-inch thick slices, forming pinwheels. Arrange 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake in 400&deg;F oven 15 to 17 minutes or until golden brown, rotating pans halfway through baking. Transfer pinwheels to wire rack; cool slightly. Serve warm.</li>
